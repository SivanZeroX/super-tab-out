## Detailed Description

```text
Super Tab Out replaces your new tab page with a local dashboard for open browser tabs.

It helps you understand what is open, find the right tab faster, clean up duplicates, and close groups of tabs without accidentally touching pinned tabs.

Highlights:
- Group tabs by domain or by Chrome's native Tab Groups
- Filter tabs instantly with the / shortcut
- Hide tab details with privacy mode before screen sharing
- Protect pinned tabs from bulk-close and duplicate-cleanup actions
- Detect duplicate pages and close extras while keeping one copy
- Save tabs for later in a local checklist
- Switch between English and Simplified Chinese
- Choose from 12 built-in visual themes
- Use a three-column local tools workbench for JSON, URLs, codecs, timestamps, real QR SVGs, hashes, cookies, and session export
- Refresh automatically when tabs open, close, or navigate
- Store preferences and saved tabs locally

Privacy:
Super Tab Out does not require an account, does not use analytics, does not sell data, and does not upload your tab list to a server. Saved tabs and preferences stay on your device. The extension may request favicons from DuckDuckGo's icon service and cache them locally for up to 7 days; users can disable external favicon requests in privacy settings.

The local tools workbench processes user input inside the extension. It does not call a backend service.
