# Privacy Policy for Super Tab Out

Last updated: April 20, 2026

Super Tab Out is a local-first Chromium extension that replaces the new tab page with a dashboard for organizing open browser tabs.

This policy explains what data the extension uses, where it is stored, and what external requests may occur.

## Single Purpose

Super Tab Out helps users organize, filter, save, restore, and close browser tabs from a local new-tab dashboard and optional side panel.

## Data the Extension Uses

Super Tab Out may read the following browser tab information to render the dashboard:

- tab title
- tab URL
- tab window ID
- tab active state
- tab pinned state
- Chrome Tab Group ID and group metadata
- recently closed tab/window metadata exposed by `chrome.sessions`

This information is used only to display and manage tabs inside the extension UI.

## Data Stored Locally

Super Tab Out stores the following data locally on the user's device:

- saved-for-later tab URLs and titles
- saved-for-later completion/archive state
- saved session URLs, titles, order, pinned state, and group labels
- lightweight local activity stats and achievement flags
- local tool favorites, recent tools, and small per-tool draft state
- privacy mode state and privacy screen settings
- selected view mode
- selected language
- selected theme
- cached favicon images

Saved tabs, preferences, and settings are stored using `chrome.storage.local` and `localStorage`.

## Data Sharing

Super Tab Out does not:

- sell user data
- use user data for advertising
- transfer tab lists to a remote server
- collect analytics or telemetry
- require an account
- run a backend service

The local tools workbench runs inside the extension. Text entered into JSON, URL, encoding, timestamp, QR, UUID/password, hash, cookie, and session export tools is processed locally and is not sent to a remote service.

## External Requests

Super Tab Out may request favicons from:

```text
https://icons.duckduckgo.com
```

These requests are used to display small site icons next to tab entries. Favicons are cached locally for up to 7 days to reduce repeated network requests.

Users can disable external favicon requests in the privacy settings. When disabled, cached favicons may still render, but new domains will not request icons from the external service.

Privacy mode does not provide a web search box and does not change the browser search provider.

## Permissions

Super Tab Out requests the following extension permissions:

| Permission | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `tabs` | Read open tabs, focus tabs, close tabs, and create tab groups |
| `storage` | Store saved tabs, saved sessions, local stats, and local preferences |
| `tabGroups` | Read, create, update, collapse, and ungroup Chrome Tab Groups |
| `sidePanel` | Show the optional side panel command center |
| `sessions` | Display and restore recently closed browser tabs/windows |

The extension requests only the permissions needed for its stated tab-dashboard purpose.

## Data Retention and Deletion

Data stored by Super Tab Out remains on the user's device until the user removes it.

Users can delete stored data by:

- removing the extension from the browser
- clearing extension site data / browser storage
- dismissing saved-for-later items inside the extension UI

## Children

Super Tab Out is a general productivity tool and is not directed at children.

## Changes

If this privacy policy changes, the updated version will be published in this repository.
